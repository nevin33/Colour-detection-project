# Colour-detection-project
Using python and open cv the webcam detects the colours red, green and blue. The program draws bounding boxes around detected objects and display their coordinates.
1.	Setup:
 Installed Python and OpenCV and ensured access to a webcam.
2.	Color Detection:
Used the HSV color space for better color segmentation. Defined color ranges for red, blue, and green. Created masks for each color to isolate objects.
3.	Bounding Boxes and Coordinates:
 For each color detected, drew a bounding box around the object. Calculated the coordinates (x, y) of the center of the bounding box. Displayed the coordinates on the live feed.
4.	Code Structure:
Organized the code into functions for modularity and readability. Included comments explaining the purpose of each section of the code.
5.	Testing (bonus)
Tested the program in various lighting conditions to ensure reliability. Adjusted the HSV thresholds and algorithms as needed for better performance.
